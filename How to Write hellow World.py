# This is famous first question for any programming language . The question is print -> Hello World!.

# one way

print('Hello World!') # so easy

#second way

print("Hello World!") # this will work fine for any statement .. but not above one.. read full to know

# third way

print('Hello'+' '+'World!') # it is like string concatenation

# Forth way

print('Hello',end=' ') # the next print statement will be start printing in the same line

print('World!')  # if no end is provided then new print statement will start printing in new line. 

# end will help you keep track of last line and it will end up with the ->' '

# Fifth Way 

print('Hello','World!')

# You might be thinking that why single single->' ' and double ->" " both are used . 

# The answer is both can be used unless we required to write sentence like -> I don't hurt animal. In ->(don't) we use single

# -> (') so this get touble in the print statement 

# eg
print('i don't hurt animal') # this will give you the error. 

# so we can use ->(") 

#eg
print("i don't hurt animal") # this will work fine. 

# congratulation . You Have learn the first basic question . 

# see you soon
